Welcome to FreeCAD-pyOpTools's documentation!
=============================================

FreeCAD-pyOpTools is a workbench designed to include in FreCAD the optical
raytracing capabilities present in the pyOpTools library. It is meant to be a
tool to help in the process of designinig and simulating an optical
systems, starting from the lenses layout, and including all the optomechanical
elements required. It is not a rendering workbench.

This workbench as well as documentation are a work in process.
